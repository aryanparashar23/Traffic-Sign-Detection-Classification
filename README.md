# Traffic-Sign-Detection-Classification
This project involves detecting and classifying traffic signs from images using deep learning techniques. The system is designed to identify various traffic signs and classify them into predefined categories. This can be useful for autonomous driving systems, traffic monitoring applications, and more.
# Features
Sign Detection: Identifies the location of traffic signs in an image.
Sign Classification: Categorizes detected signs into predefined classes (e.g., Stop, Yield, Speed Limit).
Real-time Processing: Capable of processing images in real-time for practical applications.
High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in classification using state-of-the-art models.
